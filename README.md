Project for module 6 - next.js guide
Deployed: https://next-js-blog-tau-jet.vercel.app/

I followed this tutorial on next.js blog : Learn Next.js https://nextjs.org/learn
I really like how they set up their tutorial. I learned a lot from reading all this text between the lessons, they give good explainations on how everything works. It took me rather long to finish this assignment/tutorial so I've been working with Next.js inbetween starting and finishing this project. I feel like I've gained understanding on how Next.js works and I really like how it works.
I commented a lot into the code, everything I thought was noteworthy or interesting.
